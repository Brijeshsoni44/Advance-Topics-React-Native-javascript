// âœ… Q1. What approach do you follow when starting a new cross-platform mobile app in React Native?
// âœ… Answer:

// When starting a new React Native project, I follow a structured approach:

// Requirement Gathering: Understand business needs, user flows, and technical requirements.

// Project Setup:

// Initialize the app using npx react-native init or expo init depending on the need.

// Set up folder structure (like components, screens, navigation, services).

// Install essential libraries like react-navigation, axios, redux if needed.

// Environment Setup:

// Configure environment variables (.env) for API keys, staging/production differences.

// Code Standards:

// Set up ESLint, Prettier for code formatting and consistency.

// Version Control:

// Initialize a Git repository and set up proper Git branching strategy (develop, feature, release).

// Development:

// Follow modular coding and component reusability to ensure maintainability.

// Testing:
// Write unit tests for business logic and UI tests for critical screens.
// CI/CD Integration:
// Integrate the project with CircleCI from the beginning to automate builds and deployments.
// ===============
// âœ… Q2. How do you manage app navigation in a complex React Native project?
// âœ… Answer:

// In complex React Native apps, I manage navigation by:

// Using React Navigation library â€“ itâ€™s the most popular and flexible.

// Navigation Structure:

// Create separate navigators like StackNavigator, TabNavigator, and DrawerNavigator.

// Nest navigators as needed (e.g., a Tab inside a Stack or vice versa).

// Modularization:

// Keep each navigator in a separate file (AuthNavigator.js, MainNavigator.js, etc.) to keep the code clean.

// Centralized Navigation Service:

// Use navigationRef and navigate() function globally so that even non-component files (like Redux actions) can trigger navigation.

// Deep Linking:

// Configure deep linking to allow external URLs to open specific screens inside the app.

// State Preservation:

// Use initialRouteName and handle back-button behavior properly, especially for Android users.

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// While working on apps at iFlair and Chetu, I organized complex flows (like user onboarding, payment flows, and map-based flows) by using nested navigators and maintained a clean separation between authenticated and unauthenticated routes.
// ============

// âœ… Q3. How do you handle platform-specific differences (Android vs iOS) in React Native apps?
// âœ… Answer:

// Handling platform-specific differences includes:

// Using Platform Module:

// I use Platform.OS === 'ios' or Platform.select() to apply platform-specific logic or styles.

// Conditional Styling:

// Adjust margins, paddings, and status bar heights differently for Android and iOS.

// Separate Files:

// Create platform-specific files like Component.ios.js and Component.android.js when logic or UI differs a lot.

// Handling Permissions:

// Request permissions differently (example: push notification permission on iOS vs Android).

// Native Modules:

// When using native SDKs (e.g., Google Maps, Stripe), follow platform-specific installation guides.

// Testing Thoroughly:

// Always test features on both Android emulator/device and iOS simulator/device to catch platform bugs.

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// While integrating Stripe and Google Maps, I encountered different behaviors across Android and iOS. I managed them using Platform checks and, when necessary, wrote platform-specific components for consistent user experience.

// ===========
// âœ… Q4. Can you explain the complete flow of setting up push notifications in React Native apps for Android and iOS?
// âœ… Answer:

// Setting up push notifications involves:

// Library Installation:

// Install @react-native-firebase/messaging or use expo-notifications for Expo projects.

// Firebase Setup:

// Create a Firebase project.

// Download google-services.json (Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) and integrate them into respective platforms.

// Android Setup:

// Configure AndroidManifest.xml with proper permissions and services.

// Set up Firebase messaging service for background and killed-state notifications.

// iOS Setup:

// Enable Push Notifications and Background Modes (Remote notifications) in Xcode.

// Configure APNs and upload APNs Authentication Key to Firebase.

// Request user permission using messaging().requestPermission().

// Handling Notifications:

// Handle foreground, background, and killed state notifications separately using Firebase messaging listeners.

// Testing:

// Test notifications from Firebase Console or server.

// Use physical devices (push notifications don't work on iOS Simulator).

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// In my projects at iFlair and Chetu, I integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time notifications and handled the notification click events to navigate users to specific screens.

// ==========

// Q5. How do you handle push notifications when the app is in the background or killed state?
// âœ… Answer:

// When the app is in background or killed state:

// Background State:

// Firebase Messaging automatically delivers notifications.

// Listen for the event onNotificationOpenedApp() to detect when a notification is tapped.

// Killed State:

// Use getInitialNotification() to check if the app was opened from a notification when it was closed.

// Example:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// useEffect(() => {
//   messaging().onNotificationOpenedApp(remoteMessage => {
//     // Navigate user based on notification
//   });

//   messaging().getInitialNotification().then(remoteMessage => {
//     if (remoteMessage) {
//       // Navigate user based on initial notification
//     }
//   });
// }, []);
// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// In my last project, when users clicked on a notification (example: payment update or location alert), I used onNotificationOpenedApp and getInitialNotification to navigate users to the correct screen even if the app was killed.

// // ===============
// âœ… Q6. How do you manage notification permission requests in React Native, especially on iOS?
// âœ… Answer:

// Managing notification permissions involves:

// Requesting Permission:

// On iOS, notifications require explicit user consent.

// Use the @react-native-firebase/messaging library or expo-notifications (for Expo apps).

// Example using Firebase:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';

// async function requestUserPermission() {
//   const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission();
//   const enabled =
//     authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ||
//     authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL;

//   if (enabled) {
//     console.log('Authorization status:', authStatus);
//   }
// }
// Best Practices:

// Ask for permission after explaining why you need it (don't ask immediately on app start).

// Handle the case when users deny permission â€” show a custom UI to enable from settings.

// Check permission status before requesting again to avoid annoying users.

// iOS Settings Configuration:

// Ensure Push Notifications and Background Modes are enabled in Xcode project settings.

// Upload the correct APNs Key/Certificates to Firebase if using FCM.

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// In production apps at Chetu, I always made sure to display a pre-permission screen before calling the iOS notification permission API, which significantly increased user acceptance rates.

// âœ… Q7. What steps are involved in integrating Stripe payments into a React Native application?
// âœ… Answer:

// Stripe integration steps:

// Install Stripe SDK:

// Use @stripe/stripe-react-native library.

// Backend Setup:

// Create a backend endpoint to generate a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent securely.

// Never handle secret keys directly in the mobile app.

// Initialize Stripe:

// Initialize Stripe with your publishable key:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

// <StripeProvider publishableKey="your-publishable-key">
//   <App />
// </StripeProvider>
// Create Payment Flow:

// Call your server to create a PaymentIntent.

// Use Stripeâ€™s confirmPayment method in the app.

// Example:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

// const { confirmPayment } = useStripe();

// const handlePayment = async () => {
//   const {paymentIntent, error} = await confirmPayment(clientSecret, {
//     paymentMethodType: 'Card',
//   });

//   if (error) {
//     console.error(error);
//   } else {
//     console.log('Payment successful');
//   }
// };
// Test with Stripe Test Cards:

// Always test using Stripe-provided test card numbers.

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// I integrated Stripe for both one-time and recurring payments at Chetu using @stripe/stripe-react-native and created secure backend endpoints to manage sensitive operations safely.

// âœ… Q8. What are common security considerations when implementing payment gateways like Stripe in mobile apps?
// âœ… Answer:

// Important security practices:

// Never store card details on your servers.

// Always create PaymentIntent or SetupIntent on the server â€” never expose secret keys in the app.

// Use HTTPS for backend APIs to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.

// Validate payment status on the server-side â€” never fully trust client responses.

// Implement 3D Secure (SCA) authentication for EU users, when needed.

// Handle Stripe Webhooks securely to verify successful payments.

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// During Stripe integration, I made sure the mobile app only handled the public publishable key and tokenized the card details. All sensitive operations like confirmation, refunds, and payment validation were strictly managed through secure server-side APIs.

// âœ… Q9. How do you handle errors or failed payment attempts in Stripe Payment integration in React Native?
// âœ… Answer:

// Handling errors includes:

// Catch and Display Error Messages:

// Capture errors returned by confirmPayment and display user-friendly messages.

// Example:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// if (error) {
//   Alert.alert('Payment failed', error.message);
// }
// Retry Option:

// Offer users an option to retry payment after a failed attempt.

// Backend Error Handling:

// Validate PaymentIntent status on the server (using Stripeâ€™s API) and show correct status on the app.

// Logging:

// Log errors for monitoring and debugging (e.g., to a tool like Sentry).

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// I ensured that payment errors like insufficient funds, card declined, etc., were properly caught and user-friendly feedback was given, avoiding technical terms and keeping a professional experience.
// ======================

// âœ… Q10. How did you integrate location services (Google Maps) into a React Native app?
// âœ… Answer:

// Enabled Maps SDK for Android and Maps SDK for iOS.

// Generated API keys.

// Added the API keys to AndroidManifest.xml and AppDelegate.m for Android and iOS respectively.

// Permissions:

// Asked for runtime permissions:

// Android: Used PermissionsAndroid to request ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.

// iOS: Configured Info.plist with NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription.

// Fetching User's Current Location:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// import Geolocation from '@react-native-community/geolocation';

// Geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
//   position => {
//     const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
//     console.log(latitude, longitude);
//   },
//   error => console.error(error),
//   { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 15000, maximumAge: 10000 }
// );
// Rendering MapView:

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

// <MapView
//   style={{ flex: 1 }}
//   initialRegion={{
//     latitude: userLatitude,
//     longitude: userLongitude,
//     latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
//     longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
//   }}
// >
//   <Marker coordinate={{ latitude: userLatitude, longitude: userLongitude }} />
// </MapView>
// Handling Edge Cases:

// Show fallback UI if location is not available.

// Handle permission denied scenarios gracefully.

// ðŸ”¹Real Work Reference:
// At Chetu, I integrated Google Maps for services like showing nearby service centers and tracking delivery agents live on the map. I made sure the app handles permissions, location updates, and marker clustering efficiently.

// For Payments (Stripe):

// Use Sandbox/Test Keys: Always use Stripe's test environment with test card numbers.

// Simulate Different Scenarios: Test success, failure, insufficient funds, 3D Secure authentication, etc.

// Edge Case Testing: Handle network failures, timeouts, and user cancellations gracefully.

// Security Testing: Verify that sensitive data (like card numbers) is not logged anywhere.

// For Push Notifications (FCM):

// Test on Real Devices: Since simulators don't always receive push notifications reliably.

// Test in Different States: App in foreground, background, and killed state.

// Payload Testing: Validate different types of payloads (data messages, notification messages).

// Platform Testing: Verify both Android and iOS behavior since notification handling differs.

// Automation:

// Where possible, add unit tests and integration tests for payments and notification flows.
